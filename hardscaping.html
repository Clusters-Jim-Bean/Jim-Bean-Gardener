    <h2>Hardscaping</h2>

    <p class="hardscaping-intro">Hardscaping is an aspect of landscaping that provides structure and functionality to outdoor areas. Hardscaping refers to any man made structure within landscaping design that is made of inanimate materials like gravel, brick, wood, pavers, or stone. Any solid structure in an outdoor area that is not plant life is considered hardscape. Some examples of hardscape features include driveways, patios, fountains, fire pits, and walkways. Conversely, softscaping is the form of landscape design that primarily deals with organic, living material such as trees, shrubs, and flower beds.</p>

        <p >Retaining walls are load-bearing walls that draw the boundary of a garden at the top of a hill, or the bottom of a hill, effectively damming up dirt and water runoff that would otherwise interfere with growing softscape.</p>

        <p >Garden sheds are different from greenhouses by design: sheds have solid walls and roofs (instead of panels of glass) and are used primarily for storage and potting plants (instead of for sprouting seeds or growing tender plants tricky climates).</p>

        <p >Driveways often get taken for granted. They deserve better. When it comes to creating curb appeal, the entry road that links a house to the public thoroughfare is often a homeâ€™s most prominent hardscape feature.</p>
